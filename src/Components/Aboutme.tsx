                    Hi, I'm Ville Mustonen, a passionate snowboarder and software developer.
                    I've been snowboarding my entire life, which has shaped my determined and challenge-driven mindsetâ€”qualities I also apply to coding.
                    I'm studying at Hive Helsinki, where I've focused on the fundamentals of programming and problem-solving.
                    I'm particularly fascinated by frontend development, but I'm always ready to take on new challenges and expand my skill set.
                    My previous profession as an electrician has given me a strong technical understanding and a structured approach to work.
                </p>
